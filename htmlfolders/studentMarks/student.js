ASSIGNMENT 3
Topic: Objects, operators, loops, arrays, Strings
Create a function that takes an array of a tleast 5 objects 
as its parameter. Each object is a student. The student object
 has two fields: name and marks. The name is a string -> student name. 
 The marks field is an array of 5 elements each representing the student's 
 performance in 5 subjects. Write a function that iterates through the array and gets 
 the average marks for each student. The function should print the students names and 
 their average marks in descending order. Example:
arrayOfStudents = [{name: "Stephen", marks: [45, 78, 90, 32, 67]}, 
{name: "Maryanne", marks: [89, 78, 10, 67, 47]}, {name: "Kelvin", marks: [55, 88, 94, 52, 37]}, 
{name: "Claire", marks: [44, 68, 88, 62, 77]}]
Output: Claire: 67.8
               Kelvin: 65.2
               Stephen: 62.4
               Maryanne: 58.2
Run the function with a sample array to verify the output

scores=[62,61,34,45,41]
function getSumInArray(){
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < scores.length; i++){
        sum = sum + scores[i]
    }
    return sum;
}


console.log(getSumInArray()/5)
