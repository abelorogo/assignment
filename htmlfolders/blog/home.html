    <h1>SEDAN</h1>
    <div class="car1">
        <img src="car 1.jpg" alt="" height="150px">
        <p> A sedan has four doors and a traditional trunk. Like vehicles in many categories, they're available in a range of sizes from small <br>(subcompact vehicles like Nissan Versa and Kia Rio) to compacts (Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla) to mid-size (Honda Accord, Nissan Altima), 
            and full-size (Toyota Avalon, Dodge Charger).<br> Luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and Lexus have sedans in similar sizes as well.</p>

        <img src="car3.jpg" alt="" height="150px">
        <p>These are the sportiest, hottest, coolest-looking coupes and convertiblesâ€”low to the ground,<br> sleek, and often expensive. <br>They generally are two-seaters, but sometimes have small rear seats as well. Cars like the Porsche 911 and Mazda Miata are
             typical sports cars, but you can stretch the definition to include muscle cars like the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger. Then there are the high-end exotic dream cars with sky-high price tags for the one percent, <br>cars like the Ferrari 488 GTB 
             and Aston Martin Vantage, which stop traffic with their spaceship looks.

    <h1>STATION WAGON
    </h1>

    <div class="car1">
        <img src="car4.jpg" alt="" height="150px">
        <p>Wagons are similar to sedans but have an extended 
            roofline and a hatch door at the rear instead of 
            a trunk. <br> Some, like the Subaru Outback or 
            Audi A4 Allroad, have elevated ground 
            clearance and some rugged body 
            cladding to make them more like a sport-utility vehicle (SUV), but they are nonetheless
             closely related to sedans. Wagons have fallen from favor during the past few decades and there 
             are relatively few available for sale in the United States..
