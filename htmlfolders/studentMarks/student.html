        Create a function that takes an array of a tleast 5 objects as its parameter. Each object is a student. The student object has two fields: name and marks. The name is a string -> student name. The marks field is an array of 5 elements each representing the student's performance in 5 subjects. Write a function that iterates through the array and gets the average marks for each student. The function should print the students names and their average marks in descending order. Example:
arrayOfStudents = [{name: "Stephen", marks: [45, 78, 90, 32, 67]}, {name: "Maryanne", marks: [89, 78, 10, 67, 47]}, {name: "Kelvin", marks: [55, 88, 94, 52, 37]}, {name: "Claire", marks: [44, 68, 88, 62, 77]}]
Output: Claire: 67.8
               Kelvin: 65.2
               Stephen: 62.4
               Maryanne: 58.2
Run the function with a sample array to verify the output
